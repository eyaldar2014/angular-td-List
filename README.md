# angular-td-List


planning:

to do list is made of several parts

it has input that includes add and search options (search is a filter of existing notes)

for each note (Object) there is option to delete or update. maybe even show and hide content.
The UI has box with title, content and buttons.

I want to make them dragable along the page - does angular
has the option (built in equales a library) for it? maybe not..

what else?
can add local storage for existing lists
log in with authentication
back-end mongo server for the notes that has been created


less abstructive:
- github and heroku
- ungular 1.47 structure (ng-app, files: view(front-end), controller(crud),
  factory(for notes), routes(login and notes - for start))
- brain and basic UI with CRUD functionallity
- front end written in angular, and controller
- extra: mongoDB server with authentication written in node js
- extra2: dragable notes??


actual Plan of Action:
- initialize&create git and heroku // 10 minutes
- learn and apply anglar 1.47 structure // 1 hour
- basic functioning folders structure for TD-List with and first "input" // 30 minutes
  for adding notes(later search and filter notes))
- deploy heroku now // 15 minutes
- clear js functions, with notes: CRUD brain - I would like to add Tests() // 2 hours
  * Tests for crud in angular? code must exist already online (someone did it, must have). 
    - how to apply in my project?
    - when to apply? after front-end is done, because it is secondary for basic angular learnnig. 
- angular view and basic-full draft(TD-List front end) // 3 hours
